## Hello Everyone

### I'm **Lynn** 

<img align= "right" width= "250" src= "https://pa1.narvii.com/6580/8098c6e9207376889eeb0532d9f5a0723c4d73f5_hq.gif"/>

and I'm currently a computer science student bound to graduate in May, 2027. 

I think computer science as a general major is a really vast and boundless field. I've delved into cybersecurity, cloud development,
data-structures and algorithms, web development and circuits. I'm aiming to be a full-stack developer, although, I'm also interested in 
the managerial and business side. 

Some things I would love to explore in the future if I have the time is machine learning, deep learning and
game development.

| *Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.* <br /> <br />  - Steve Jobs| <p>My Favorite Painting</p> <img src="/img1.jpeg" alt="Painting, Wanderer Above The Sea Of Fogs" width="1000"/>&nbsp; |
